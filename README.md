### Hi I'm Jordan Ashment!

I am a web developer with experience in both the Frontend and Backend.  I am familiar with languages and frameworks such as:  
 
[![ReactJS](tropical-lavender-manatee.faviconkit.com/reactjs.org/128)](https://reactjs.org/) ReactJS  
[![VueJS](tropical-lavender-manatee.faviconkit.com/vuejs.org/128)](https://vuejs.org/) VueJS  
[![NodeJS](tropical-lavender-manatee.faviconkit.com/nodejs.org/128)](https://nodejs.org/en/)NodeJS  
[![Firebase](tropical-lavender-manatee.faviconkit.com/firebase.google.com/128)](https://firebase.google.com/)Firebase  
[![Git/Github](tropical-lavender-manatee.faviconkit.com/github.com/128)](https://github.com/)Git/Github  
[![MongoDB](tropical-lavender-manatee.faviconkit.com/mongodb.com/128)](https://www.mongodb.com/)MonogDB  
[![Python](tropical-lavender-manatee.faviconkit.com/python.org/128)](https://www.python.org/)Python  


I've also had experience with many other languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ExpressJS, Mongoose etc. I love learning new things and trying out languages and frameworks. I have the most experience with React and Node right now seeing as that is what I build with at my job.  

I have a bachelor's degree in Web Design and Development (Emphasis in Web and App Development) and have built some interesting things. I absolutely love what I do and I will continue to have a passion for development forever!
