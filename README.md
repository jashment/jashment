### Hi I'm Jordan Ashment!

I am a web developer with experience in both the Frontend and Backend.  I am familiar with languages such as:  
 
[![ReactJS](https://api.faviconkit.com/reactjs.org/)](https://reactjs.org/) ReactJS  
[![VueJS](https://api.faviconkit.com/vuejs.org/)](https://vuejs.org/) VueJS

I've also had experience with many other languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ExpressJS, Mongoose etc. I love learning new things and trying out languages and frameworks. I have the most experience with React and Node right now seeing as that is what I build with at my job.  

I have a bachelor's degree in Web Design and Development (Emphasis in Web and App Development) and have built some interesting things. I absolutely love what I do and I will continue to have a passion for development forever!
